Feedback for user-ID cgmj52 at May  2 13:39:19

Throughout this validation, as many error messages as possible are returned in order to help you
understand what might have gone wrong. However, note that sometimes a single error might lead to
early termination of the validation process so that fixing this error results in more, as yet
unseen errors. So, the list of error messages might not be exhaustive but it's the best I can do!

The first part of this feedback is validation of the program files that you submitted, in terms
of the key information they need to contain. At this stage, the programs are not executed; that
will follow later. Please note that for any program cluster, if any of the following are true 
then the program cluster is INVALID and neither it nor the tours it produces will secure any marks:
 - the basic program does not exist
 - the basic program exists but its user-name mis-matches the definitive user-name
 - the basic program exists but its algorithm code is illegal
 - the basic program exists but it imports an illegal module
 - the enhanced program exists but its user-name mismatches the definitive user-name
 - the enhanced program exists but its algorithm code mis-matches with that of the basic program
 - the enhanced program exists but it imports an illegal module.
Also, if you have two valid program clusters but they have the same algorithm code then both
clusters are invalid. (Of course, invalidity can be avoided if you check your programs using this
program prior to submission!)

#####  Program submission
#####   * program cluster AlgA:
#####      - AlgAbasic.py: successful validation (genetic algorithm, tariff 6)
              *** Warning: you appear to have altered the core skeleton code even though I told you
              not to! So, your code might not run for me. I would fix this if I were you.
              Discrepancies appear in sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
#####      - AlgAenhanced.py: successful validation (genetic algorithm, tariff 6)
              *** Warning: you appear to have altered the core skeleton code even though I told you
              not to! So, your code might not run for me. I would fix this if I were you.
              Discrepancies appear in sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
#####   * program cluster AlgB:
#####      - AlgBbasic.py: successful validation (ant colony optimization, tariff 9)
              *** Warning: you appear to have altered the core skeleton code even though I told you
              not to! So, your code might not run for me. I would fix this if I were you.

#####      - AlgBenhanced.py: successful validation (ant colony optimization, tariff 9)
              *** Warning: you appear to have altered the core skeleton code even though I told you
              not to! So, your code might not run for me. I would fix this if I were you.

The next part of this feedback is validation of the tour files that you submitted. Each has been
validated and the outcome is described below. If any tour has an associated error message then it
is deemed to be invalid and it will secure no marks. Remember: as stated above, any tours arising
from an invalid program cluster will not secure any marks (irrespective of whether they are
actually legal tours or not). The tour lengths of successfully validated tours given below go to
form your tour-quality mark.

#####  Tour file submission
#####   * program cluster AlgA:
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile012.txt: valid tour of length 56 (genetic algorithm)
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile017.txt: valid tour of length 1504 (genetic algorithm)
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile021.txt: valid tour of length 2549 (genetic algorithm)
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile026.txt: valid tour of length 1473 (genetic algorithm)
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile042.txt: valid tour of length 1192 (genetic algorithm)
#####      - AlgA_AISearchfile048.txt: valid tour of length 12248 (genetic algorithm)

#####      - AlgB_AISearchfile535.txt: valid tour of length 50940 (ant colony optimization)

The next part of this feedback states whether the proforma and the validation feedback were submitted.

#####  Additional items submission
#####   * AISearchProforma.pdf: not submitted
#####   * AISearchValidationFeedback.txt: not submitted

Of course, the validation feedback file will be flagged as 'not submitted' as it is this file!
